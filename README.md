# JABC HR Solution

This is a working repository for Team OECM's JABC HR Solution. This README will document major components of this solution. If you are a maintainer of this repository, please remember to keep this document up-to-date with important latest changes.

Features are to be developed in branches off of master, and merged into master with the approval of _at least_ one external reviewer. When you have branched off of master, please remember to pull master often to mitigate the risk of merge conflicts. A basic Git workflow for development of the JABC HR solution is as follows

1. Create a feature branch off of master in the format [initials]/[JIRA issue number]. For example, the associated branch name for a developer named "Paul Carter" who is assigned the ticket JA-12 (write unit tests for database facade) would be `pc/JA-12`.
2. Once you have completed the feature to your satisfaction, please make a pull request with the title [Jira Issue number]: [brief description], and tag all team members for review. For example, the pull request title for the branch `pc/JA-12` would be "JA-12: write unit tests for DBFacade".
3. Do _not_ merge branches into master without the approval of at least one other team member.
